# Smilevery App

## Team arrayOfLight: Practicum International Code Jam October 2021

### About

This App portion of the project was created using React.

The concept was to create a personalised greeting card to be sent with an order from a partner's shop.

There are three basic designs but this will be expanded in the future to include more, and also to allow the user the upload a custom image.

The simple card editor overlays the text message on the images and generates the card.

The image is generated with the external library HTML2Canvas which used the contents of the postcard in the DOM to create a PNG.

At this point, the app will create a code that the user can use on the partner's site. Future options would include having the card automatically forwarded to the merchant.

The main allows the user to register on the site and even communicate with the creators.




### Future Plans

The location page should show participating merchant stores near or around the recipient (especially if in another country) via use of Google Maps.

For touch input devices, a handwriting field may be added for an even more personal touch.

Make the app responsive to all screen resolutions.
